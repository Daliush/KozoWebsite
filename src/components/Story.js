                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                Most Challenger coaches did exactly what you didâ€”they spammed games and got a different result.
                </p>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                For me, spamming games didnâ€™t get me past D4, no matter how much I tried or how many YouTube videos I watched.

                <h2 className='hiddenStory'>The Awakening</h2>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                I had to seek out all the knowledge on performance maximization psychology for several years, learning from some of the best coaches in the world across nearly all roles to leave nothing to chance on my off-roles, driven by a hunger for knowledge. This is what allowed me to climb to rank 512 in EUW.

                <h2 className='hiddenStory'>The Methodology</h2>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                Consciously knowing how to create repeatable results for the vast majority of players. Itâ€™s difficult to teach someone what you havenâ€™t done yourself
                </p>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                Specifically, completely shattering your glass ceiling (the so-called DNA gap). But I had to do it to reach High Grandmaster 689 LP after 5 years of being stuck in low Diamond.

                <h2 className='hiddenStory'>Reflective Insight</h2>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                If I could coach myself from 3 years ago, I would have achieved it in about 6 months. Iâ€™m absolutely certain you wonâ€™t find a more effective methodology anywhere for improving and climbing.

                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                I created an academy to achieve insane results for most players, all within a healthy atmosphere where everyone wants to improve.
                </p>
                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                I deeply understand the root of the problem and how to solve it, and it exasperated me to see coaches spouting ineffective knowledge.

                <p className='paragraphStory hiddenStory'>
                Iâ€™m training players who will become my future coaches, so they can carry on my philosophy in the academy when Iâ€™m more focused on the pro level.

                My methodology works very effectively for all my dedicated students, of all roles and all ranks, so why not you? If youâ€™re ready to question what you think you know and have the hunger to improve, my academy is for you ðŸ™‚
